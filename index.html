<ul id="directions"> 
  <li> We have two types of square, <em id="alive">alive</em> and <em id="dead">dead</em> </li>
  <li>When you click the play button, the board determined which squares are alive for the next generation by the following rules:
    <ul>
      <li>Alive squares with less than 2 neighbors die, as if by underpopulation</li>
      <li>Alive squares with more than 3 neighbors die, as if by overpopulation </li>
      <li>Dead squares with exactly 3 neighbors come to life, as if by reproduction </li>
      <li>All other squares keep their present status for the next generation</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Clicking a square switches it from alive to dead or dead to alive </li>
  <li>Pressing the clear button sets all squares on the board to dead</li>

</ul>
